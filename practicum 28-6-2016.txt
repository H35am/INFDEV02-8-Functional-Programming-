Design patterns practicum:

Implement three of the following design patterns:
- A factory "F", which builds instances of interface "I", which can be implemented by classes "A" and "B". "I" has a method "describe" which returns a string describing the current instance ("A" or "B");

- An option datatype;

- A traditional iterator;

- An adapter from arrays to your traditional iterator.
