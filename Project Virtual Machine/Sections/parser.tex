The Parser is defined in the Project \texttt{SVMParser} in the template solution. Please do not alter in any way this project otherwise the template will not work properly. The data structures you have to use to interface with the parser are defined in the file \texttt{AST.fs}. Import the module \texttt{SVMAST} after adding a reference to the \texttt{SVMParser} in the project you use for your own implementation to use the data structures. The parser processes the source file you want to load and creates a \texttt{Program} data structures, which is a list containing \texttt{Instructions}. The \texttt{Instruction} type is a discriminate union containing the definition of all the possible statements in Assembly SVM. Each \texttt{Instruction} can accept one or more arguments. Each \texttt{Argument} can be a literal (value) of type integer, floating point, or string, a \texttt{Register}, or a memory address. Some operators will accept only a \texttt{Register} as left argument (see the instruction specification below). \texttt{Registers} are represented as a discriminated union where each case represents the register itself.
